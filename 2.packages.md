# Packages

* Used to group together classes in a namespace.
* It allows separating classes that are unrelated.
* Sometimes two distinct classes have the same. Packaging helps to distinguish them. For example, java.util.Date and
  java.sql.Date class.
* Suppose we have a package called mycode that must use the java.util.Date class. Either we can do import
  java.util.Date; and then use Date class or use the whole name like `java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();`
* The name in the generated .class file is always fully qualified name.
* First statement must always be the package statement, if it exists. Then comes the set of import statements before any
  code.
* Even though packages appear to be hierarchical, if package b is within package a, then import a.* will not import
  classes from package b, which is technically the package a.b! Packages a and a.b are distinct packages without any
  real relationship between them.
* Only modifiers allowed before package declaration are annotations like @Deprecated. But if package x.y is there in
  multiple source files, it must be annotated only once and this can be hard to keep track of. A solution to this
  problem is to use a package-info.java file. Due to the hyphen, we cannot use this name as an identifier (class name
  cannot be this). Only put package declarations and package docs in this file.
