# Introduction to Java

* A solid object-oriented language that was inspired by C++.
* The dev team tried to make the Java better than C++ via good design principles, that they learned through their
  experiences with C++.
* Modern Java has introduced a lot of Functional Programming concepts, which is important for big data and massively
  parallel computations. Also, modern hardware is not getting faster, but more parallel (more cores in the CPU).
* Core Java comes with many libraries (more than 4700 classes), third-party would be much higher.
* Java runs on the JVM platform which is efficient and secure.
